## Architecture
- All data access goes through src/lib/api.ts (USE_MOCK toggles mock vs FastAPI at VITE_API_URL); components use hooks in src/hooks, never fetch — so the backend can be swapped without touching UI.
- Domain types live only in src/lib/types.ts; citation parsing only in src/lib/citations.ts.
- Page UIs live in src/pages and are mounted by thin TanStack route files (src/routes), since TanStack Start replaces App.tsx/main.tsx.
- Workspace tabs are a config list in WorkspaceTabs.tsx; add future tabs there.
